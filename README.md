./gradlew build
```

### 3. Run the server

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The Eureka dashboard should be available at:
👉 `http://localhost:8761`

## 🔧 Configuration

Update your `application.yml` or `application.properties`:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false
    fetch-registry: false
```

## 📦 Registering a Microservice

Each client service should include:

```yaml
eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
```

And include the dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
